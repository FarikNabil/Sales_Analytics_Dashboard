Sales Analytics Dashboard with Python, MySQL & Power BI

Aug 2025 - Aug 2025Aug 2025 - Aug 2025
I recently completed a sales data analytics project — from raw data processing to building an interactive dashboard for business insights.

💡 Project Workflow:
1. Data Preparation
o Imported a sales dataset (.CSV) from Kaggle
o Cleaned and transformed data using Python (Pandas)

2. Database Management
o Stored structured data in MySQL
o Created tables and executed SQL queries for analysis

3. Visualization
o Connected the database directly to Power BI
o Designed an interactive dashboard with month/day slicers and product category analysis

📊 Tools & Skills:
• Python (Pandas, Data Cleaning, Data Manipulation)
• MySQL (Data Storage, Querying, Integration)
• Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Visualization, Dashboard Design)

🔍 Key Insights:
• Peak Sales Month: December showed the highest sales volume, suggesting strong holiday season demand.
• Best-Selling Category: Beverages consistently led the sales, indicating high repeat purchases.
• Day-of-Week Trend: Sales were significantly higher on weekends, suggesting increased customer activity during leisure time.

🎯 Outcome:
An interactive dashboard enabling business stakeholders to quickly explore sales trends, monitor performance, and identify growth opportunities.
